# Flask-Quotes-to-englighten

This repository contains the code for a simple blogging web application built with Flask, a popular Python web framework. The project was created as part of my learning journey to understand Flask and its features, such as routing, templates, forms, and databases.

In this project, I implemented basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities for blog posts, user authentication with password hashing, and pagination. The application uses a Mysql database to store data and SQLAlchemy as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library to interact with the database.
